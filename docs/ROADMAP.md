# VEETANCE Engine Manifest & Roadmap 🦾📊

## [1] Manifold Audit: Phase 4 Synthesis ✅
MrVee, we have transformed the engine from a terrestrial script into a high-octane **Hybrid Graphics Manifold**.

### **ADDED (The High-Fidelity Foundations)**
*   **Parallel Tiled Rasterizer**: Multi-core rendering via Web Workers and `SharedArrayBuffer`. ☢️
*   **Cluster-Based Frustum Culling**: Aggressive WASM-side visibility filtering for 1M+ face models. 🔳
*   **Sovereign Origin Isolation**: COOP/COEP management for high-performance memory. 🛡️
*   **Modular Architecture**: UI is now fragmented (`sidebar.js`, `hud.js`) and orchestrated by a central `UIMaster`.
*   **Streaming I/O pipeline**: Multi-threaded, chunk-based OBJ parsing via Web Workers. No more UI freeze on large imports.
*   **The "Deep Crunch" CPU Loop**: Zero-allocation rendering, O(N) Radix Sort, and batched WASM Rasterization. 🚀
*   **Adaptive Sparse Wireframe**: Density-controlled line rendering for ultra-fluid viewport interaction. 🔳
*   **Geometric Perfection**: Corrected Dodecahedron, Icosahedron, and Octahedron primitives. ✧

## [2] The Next Frontier: Remaining Objectives 🛰️🔭

### **The "Novel" Renderer (Final BEAUTY FX)**
*   **ASCII Overlay**: Injecting the character-based luminance mapping.
*   **Crosshatched Shadows**: Designing the GLSL logic to replace standard gradients with digital cross-hatching.
*   **Advanced Lighting Manifold**: Implementation of Screen-Space Shadows and Ambient Occlusion (AO).

### **Hardware & Logic Optimizations**
*   **QEM Retopology**: Implement Quadric Error Metrics simplification in C++ for sharp edge preservation.
*   **Quaternion Camera Manifold**: Transition from Euler angles (X/Y/Z) to a high-fidelity Quaternion orientation system.
*   **Static Buffer Optimization**: Move to Static VBOs with Uniform Matrices for 144+ FPS performance.

### **System Architecture**
*   **UV & Material Subsystem**: Integrating UV coordinate support and texture buffers for multi-layered surface manifestation.
*   **The Scene Graph (Outliner)**: Moving from "One Model" to a Multi-Object Workspace with hierarchical parent-child transforms.
*   **Binary Streaming**: Adding direct **GLB/glTF** binary support for ultra-fast data ingestion.
