# VEETANCE: Manifold Recalibration Chronicle 🔳🧬

This document archives the high-fidelity structural and aesthetic transformations executed under the direction of **MrVee**.

## 1. Aesthetic Manifest: Clinical Minimalism 🦾✨
The system has been purged of terrestrial "glow" motifs to achieve absolute structural clarity.
- **Iconography**: Migrated to Google Material Symbols (`cached`, `pan_tool`, `ink_selection`, `cycle`, `fullscreen`).
- **Typography**: Enforced thin-weight (200) Inter/Material manifestation across all UI labels and icons.
- **Lighting**: Excised all blooming shadows, text glows, and neon overflows. Manifestations now use clinical **Inset Borders** (1px) and **Opacity Shards** (60%) for state-awareness.
- **Loading Phase**: Redesigned as a **Nested Square Orbital**. Two razor-thin squares rotating in counter-resonance (CW/CCW) to signify geometric stabilization.

## 2. Interaction & State Manifold 🚀
Inducted logic to reduce semantic friction during stage manipulation.
- **"Select" Default**: The system now defaults to Select mode. Transform modes (Move/Rotate/Scale) are transient.
- **Click-Away Reset**: Clicking the stage background (Canvas) automatically decommissioned active transform modes back to Select.
- **Gizmo Island**: Transitioned to an **Icon-Only** fleet. Semantic labels are now hidden until hover-manifestation (Slide-up effect).
- **Identity Awareness**: The Infobar was recalibrated from "Mode" to **"Model"**. It now preserves the filename of external assets (GLB/OBJ) throughout the session.

## 3. High-Fidelity Geometry Engine 🪐
Recalibrated the core engine to accommodate extraterrestrial-scale manifests.
- **Buffer Expansion**: 
    - `MAX_VERTICES`: 2,000,000
    - `MAX_FACES`: 1,500,000
- **Standardization**: All primitives (Pyramid, Cube, Octahedron, etc.) are calibrated to a uniform **4.0 unit** diameter.
- **Sit-Flat Protocol**: Every manifestation (Primitive or External Asset) is automatically shifted so its absolute minimum Z-point touches the **Z=0 plane**.
- **External Asset Alignment**: 
    - Recalibrated OBJ/GLB parser for **Y-UP to Z-UP rotation**.
    - Increased external asset scale to **15.0 units** for stage dominance.
- **Starfield Rendition**: The "Points" mode was evolved into a **Celestial Starfield**. Features sub-pixel markers with stochastic alpha-shimmering for high-density vertex clouds (50K+).

## 4. UI Structural Integrity 🔳
- **Primitive Switcher**: Enforced rigid **32x32 Square** manifestation. Prevented vertical stretching and aspect-ratio drift through flex-base alignment and min-dimension anchors.
- **Nav-Pad**: Consolidated into a unified 3x3 high-density grid. Corner modes (Orbit/Pan) utilize transparent manifests with 60% inactive opacity.
