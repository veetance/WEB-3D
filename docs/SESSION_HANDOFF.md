# VEETANCE SESSION HANDOFF CHECKPOINT
**Session ID:** 977f6432 (Optimization & Modularization Phase)
**Date:** 2025-12-26

## 1. Engine Architecture Re-Factor
The monolithic code stucture has been successfully fragmented into a semantic module system.
- **`js/core/engine.js`**: Main Render Loop, Projection, Clipping, Sorting.
- **`js/ui/ui.js`**: DOM Registry and Event Binding.
- **`js/interaction/controls.js`**: Mouse/Wheel input manifold (Orbit/Pan).
- **`js/io/transfer.js`**: File Ingest (OBJ/GLB) and Exporter.
- **`js/workers/geometry.worker.js`**: **NEW** Multi-threaded Geometry Processor.
- **`js/index.js`**: Lean entry point.

## 2. Parallel Processing (Threaded Decimation)
- Implemented `Optimizer.decimate` as an **Async** function returning a Promise.
- **Web Worker:** `geometry.worker.js` handles the heavy O(N) Vertex Clustering off the main thread.
- **Algorithm:** Uses linear integer hashing (`Int32Array`) and grid quantization to crush high-poly models into low-poly game assets without UI freezing.
- **Floating Point Fix:** Corrected grid snapping logic to prevent vertex jitter/noise.

## 3. Control Scheme (Finalized)
### Orbit Logic (Spherical Manifold)
- **Left Mouse/One Finger:** Rotates camera around `(0,0,0)`.
- **Logic:** Updates `camera.orbitX` (Pitch) and `camera.orbitY` (Yaw).
- **Smoothness:** Direct mapping (1:1), no damping needed for precision work.

### Pan Logic (Planar Shift)
- **Right Mouse/Two Fingers:** Moves the camera target `(tx, ty, tz)`.
- **Coordinate System:** Moves in local view-space (X/Y relative to camera angle).

### Zoom Logic (Dolly)
- **Scroll/Pinch:** Updates `camera.zoom`.
- **Constraint:** Clamped between `min: 2` and `max: 50`.

## 4. Current State (Persistence)
All rendering state is now centralized in `js/state/store.js`.
- **Global Store:** Redux-like pattern with `dispatch` and `subscribe`.
- **Responsive:** Logic is decoupled from UI; UI just subscribes to changes.

# CHECKPOINT UPDATE (Geometry & UI Stabilization Phase)
**Session ID:** 977f6433
**Date:** 2025-12-27

## 1. Geometric & Topological Stabilization
We neutralized critical projection and topology errors that were distorting the manifold.
- **Aspect Ratio Fallacy**: Purged the incorrect `aspect` multiplier from `projectBuffer` in `math.js`. 3D units now map 1:1 to pixels, fixing the "Rectangular Cube" bug.
- **Universal CCW Winding**: Standardized all primitives (Pyramid, Cube, Prism) to **Counter-Clockwise (CCW)** index winding. This resolved the "Inside-Out" culling inversion.
- **Platonic Solid Verification**:
    - **Dodecahedron**: Replaced manual/broken indexing with a verified golden-ratio vertex generation and standard adjacency map.
    - **Icosahedron**: Implemented precise 20-face geometric definition.
- **Base Plane Restoration**: Fixed missing bottom faces on Pyramid and Cube by correcting winding order for negative-Z viewing.

## 2. UI & Aesthetics (The Squircle Shift)
Transitioned the entire visualization interface to a modern, high-density aesthetic.
- **Squircle Standard**: Eliminated all `50%` circular radii. Buttons, spinners, and inputs now use `6px-16px` "Squircle" radii for a tactical, premium feel.
- **Dynamic View Modes**:
    - **SHADED_WIRE (▣)**: Promoted to Default. Combines clinical shading with structural mesh analysis.
    - **SOLID (■)**: Depth-sorted purely shaded view.
    - **WIRE (⬚)**: "True" Wireframe with backface culling bypassed (X-Ray view).
    - **POINTS (⠂)**: Vertex cloud projection.
- **Floating HUD**: Implemented a "No-UI" mode toggle and refined the Performance HUD with chromatic hierarchy (FPS > GEO > CPU).

## 3. Engine Core Updates
- **Software Renderer (CPU)**: Confirmed and optimized the localized software pipeline. No GPU/WebGL dependency.
- **State Logic**: Fixed reducer deadlocks where `SET_VIEW_MODE` and `SET_TRANSFORM_MODE` were not persisting to the Store.
- **Viewport Sync**: Implemented `ResizeObserver` with synchronous frame injection to eliminate black-flicker during window resizing.

## 4. Known Constraints
- **Lighting**: Simple Dot-Product directional light. No shadows or ambient occlusion yet.
- **UVs**: **Zero UV Logic**. The engine uses raw vertex shading. Textures are not supported by design (Geometry First).

## 5. Next Priorities
- **Asset I/O**: Robust OBJ export validation.
- **Shader Pipeline**: Implementation of Flat vs Gouraud shading toggles.
- **Touch Support**: Mobile-first gesture mapping for the new Squircle controls.

# CHECKPOINT UPDATE (Aesthetic Excellence & Asset Manifold Expansion)
**Session ID:** 977f6434
**Date:** 2025-12-27

## 1. Aesthetic Purge & Clinical Manifest 🦾✨
Systematically decommissioned the terrestrial "glow" motif to achieve absolute structural clarity.
- **Iconography Evolution**: Migrated to Google Material Symbols (`cached`, `pan_tool`, `ink_selection`, `cycle`, `fullscreen`).
- **Typography Calibration**: Enforced thin-weight (200) Inter/Material fonts across all manifestations.
- **Zero-Glow Protocol**: Purged all blooming shadows and neon overflows. Replaced with razor-thin Inset Borders (1px) and Opacity Shards (60%) for inactive states.
- **Loading Manifest**: Redesigned as a **Nested Square Orbital**—two squares rotating in counter-resonance (CW/CCW).

## 2. Interaction & State Logic 🚀
- **Select-Centricity**: The stage now defaults to Select mode. Transform modes (Move/Rotate/Scale) are transient.
- **Click-Away Reset**: Clicking the canvas background automatically decommissioned active transform modes back to Select.
- **Gizmo Island**: Transitioned to an **Icon-Only** fleet. Semantic labels are now hidden until hover-manifestation (Slide-up effect).
- **Identity Maintenance**: The Infobar now preserves external asset filenames (GLB/OBJ) throughout the session, synchronized via the `currentPrimitive` state.

## 3. High-Fidelity Geometry Engine 🪐
- **Manifold Expansion**: Recalibrated limits to accommodate high-poly extraterrestrial assets.
    - `MAX_VERTICES`: 2,000,000
    - `MAX_FACES`: 1,500,000
- **Geometric Standard**: All primitives (Pyramid, Cube, Octahedron, etc.) are now calibrated to a uniform **4.0 unit** diameter.
- **Sit-Flat Protocol**: Every manifestation is automatically shifted so its absolute minimum Z-point touches the **Z=0 plane**.
- **External Asset Alignment**: 
    - Recalibrated OBJ/GLB parser for correct **Y-UP to Z-UP rotation**.
    - Enforced tri-axial centering and a 15.0 unit scale factor for stage dominance.
- **Starfield Induction**: Evolved "Points" mode into a shimmering celestial Starfield. Features sub-pixel markers with stochastic alpha-flicker for high-density vertex clouds (50K+).

## 4. Known Constraints 🔳
- **Buffer Saturation**: While expanded, extreme models (2M+ faces) will still hit RangeError limits.
- **Radix Sort Efficiency**: High-density models (1M+ faces) on the main thread cause brief UI hang during sort phases.

## 5. Next Priorities 🚀
- **Worker-Based Radix Sort**: Offloading face sorting to the geometry worker.
- **Adaptive Decimation**: Triggering automated decimation for assets exceeding the 500K face threshold.
- **Unified Gizmo Transform**: Implementation of on-stage draggables for Move/Rotate handle.
